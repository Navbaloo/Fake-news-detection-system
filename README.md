# Fake-news-detection-system
A deep learning project that detects fake news articles using an LSTM model built with TensorFlow. The system processes news text with NLP techniques tokenization, word embeddings and trains a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for classification.

Features 

Preprocesses raw text (tokenization).

Uses word embeddings for better text representation.

Implements an LSTM neural network in TensorFlow/Keras.

Classifies news articles with high accuracy.

Easy to extend with other datasets or models.
